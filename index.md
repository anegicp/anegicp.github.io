# Anegi CPSC 120L Portfolio
Hi, my name is Anegi Castillo I am majoring in computer science. This was a tough journey to get to this point.

## Lab 8 - part - one
Lab 8 part one was my favorite lab because it was a repeat of a previous lab we had to do. So when we did it wer only had to do the header then copy and paste the work from a different lab. it was also interesting using Ham Rye and Mayo in a coding enviroment.

## Lab 1 - part - one
Lab 1 was such a new experience for me because i never knew how to code so i was entering a completely new atmosphere. That is when i learned how to git clone, git commit, git add, git push, and git status. So it was the most influential lab, and looking back now i understand what more and more everyday. That is why it is one of my favorites.
 
## Lab 2 - part - one
Lab two was when i experienced true confusion for the first time, i was so lost working on this assignment, especially not knowing anything about coding. This and lab 4 were humbling becuase those are the ones i recieved the worst grades and understood the least. They made me realize that i have to lock in or i would fail. But im still on the edge so we will see. But never the less its one of my favorites becuase it challenged me/

## Conclusion
This year of computer science has been a long journey especially with the adversity i faced with learning how to code, and learning C++.
